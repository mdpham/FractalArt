# FractalArt
Visual art based on using iterated function systems to generate 2D and 3D Hilbert curves.
These curves may be used to sort images based on characterizing each by a point in RGB space.
Hilbert curves preserve locality and so a gradient colour is produced (provided sufficient filling of the RGB space).
